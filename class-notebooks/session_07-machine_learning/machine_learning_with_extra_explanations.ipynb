    "# Glossary of Terms \n",
    "- **Learning**: In machine learning, you'll hear about \"learning a model.\" This is what you probably know as \n",
    "*fitting* or *estimating* a function, or *training* or *building* a model. These terms are all synonyms and are \n",
    "used interchangeably in the machine learning literature.\n",
    "- **Examples**: These are what you probably know as *data points* or *observations*. \n",
    "- **Features**: These are what you probably know as *independent variables*, *attributes*, *predictors*, \n",
    "or *explanatory variables.*\n",
    "- **Underfitting**: This happens when a model is too simple and does not capture the structure of the data well \n",
    "enough.\n",
    "- **Overfitting**: This happens when a model is too complex or too sensitive to the noise in the data; this can\n",
    "result in poor generalization performance, or applicability of the model to new data. \n",
    "- **Regularization**: This is a general method to avoid overfitting by applying additional constraints to the model. \n",
    "For example, you can limit the number of features present in the final model, or the weight coefficients applied\n",
    "to the (standardized) features are small.\n",
    "- **Supervised learning** involves problems with one target or outcome variable (continuous or discrete) that we want\n",
    "to predict, or classify data into. Classification, prediction, and regression fall into this category. We call the\n",
    "set of explanatory variables $X$ **features**, and the outcome variable of interest $Y$ the **label**.\n",
    "- **Unsupervised learning** involves problems that do not have a specific outcome variable of interest, but rather\n",
    "we are looking to understand \"natural\" patterns or groupings in the data - looking to uncover some structure that \n",
    "we do not know about a priori. Clustering is the most common example of unsupervised learning, another example is \n",
    "principal components analysis (PCA).\n"

    "points or over time and space.\n",
    "- **Method selection.** Having formulated the problem and created your features, you now have a suite of methods to\n",
    "choose from. It would be great if there were a single method that always worked best for a specific type of problem. Typically, in machine learning, you take a variety of methods and try them, empirically validating which one is the best approach to your problem.\n",

    "Our features are our dependent variables or predictors. Good features make machine learning systems effective. \n",
    "The better the features the easier it is the capture the structure of the data. You generate features by a combination of domain knowledge. In general, it is better to have more complex features and a simpler model rather than vice versa. Keeping the model simple makes it faster to train and easier to understand rather then extensively searching for the \"right\" model and \"right\" set of parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning Algorithms learn a solution to a problem from sample data. The set of features is the best representation of the sample data to learn a solution to a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Feature engineering** is the process of transforming raw data into features that better represent the underlying problem/data/structure  to the predictive models, resulting in improved model accuracy on unseen data.\" ( from [Discover Feature Engineering](http://machinelearningmastery.com/discover-feature-engineering-how-to-engineer-features-and-how-to-get-good-at-it/) ).  In text, for example, this might involve deriving traits of the text like word counts, verb counts, or topics to feed into a model rather than simply giving it the raw text.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of feature engineering are: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Transformations**, such a log, square, and square root.\n",
    "- **Dummy (binary) variables**, also known as *indicator variables*, often done by taking categorical variables\n",
    "(such as city) which do not have a numerical value, and adding them to models as a binary value.\n",
    "- **Discretization**. Several methods require features to be discrete instead of continuous. This is often done \n",
    "by binning, which you can do by equal width. \n",
    "- **Aggregation.** Aggregate features often constitute the majority of features for a given problem. These use \n",
    "different aggregation functions (*count, min, max, average, standard deviation, etc.*) which summarize several\n",
    "values into one feature, aggregating over varying windows of time and space. For example, given urban data, \n",
    "we would want to calculate the *number* (and *min, max, mean, variance*, etc.) of crimes within an *m*-mile radius\n",
    "of an address in the past *t* months for varying values of *m* and *t*, and then use all of them as features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our preliminary features are the following\n",
    "\n",
    "- `nadmits` (Aggregation): Number of times someone has been addmitted to prison between 1989-2005. The more times someone has been to prison the more times they are likely continue to be arrested. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `age_first_admit` (Transformation): The age someone was first admitted to prison. This is calculated by subtracting their `birth_yr` from the year they were first admitted into prison. The idea behind creating this feature is that people who are younger when they are first arrested are more likely to be arrested again. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `gang` (Binary): A binary (true/false) indicator of whether the person has ever been in a gang. This feature takes whatever gang membership (e.g., VL, LK BPM) and encodes affiliation as 1 and no affiliation (NULL) as 0.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- `married` (Binary): If the `marstat` field is `M`, then `married` is 1, or else it is 0 for any other categories, such as Single (`S`), Divorced (`D`), Widowed (`W`). \n",
    "\n",
    "- `job` (Binary): Does the person have a job lined up when they are released from prison: `Y` (1) or `N` (0), using the field `empplanf`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- `vetf` (Binary): Is the individual a veteran? `Y` (1) or `N`(0).\n",
    "\n",
    "- (`drugalcf, drugcocf, drugampf, drugmarf, drugherf, drugpcpf, drughothf, drugunkf`) (Binary): Used alcohol, cocaine, marijuana, heroin, pcp, other, unknown, respectively. For each field, `1` (positive) or `0` (negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "- `educlvl` (Binary): `1` for graduated high school or above, `0` otherwise.(*Caution: I belive the meaning of the values of this field changed overtime*) \n",
    "\n",
    "- `crtfind` (Binary): `1` for habitual offender or repeated abuser of children, `0` otherwise (as determined by the court). "

    "It's not enough to just build the model; we're going to need a way to know whether or not it's working. Convincing others of the quality of results is often the *most challenging* part of an analysis.  Making repeatable, well-documented work with clear success metrics makes all the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convince ourselves - and others - that our modeling results will generalize, we need to hold\n",
    "some data back (not using it to train the model), then apply our model to that hold-out set and \"blindly\" predict, comparing the model's predictions to what we actually observed. This is called **cross-validation**, and it's the best way we have to estimate how a model will perform on *entirely* novel data. We call the data used to build the model the **training set**, and the rest the **test set**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we'd like our training set to be as large as possible, to give our model more information. However, you also want to be as confident as possible that your model will be applicable to new data, or else the model is useless. In practice, you'll have to balance these two objectives in a reasonable way.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many ways to split up your data into training and testing sets. Since you're trying to evaluate how your model will perform *in practice*, it's best to emulate the true use case of your model as closely as possible when you decide how to evaluate it. A good [tutorial on cross-validation](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) can be found on the `scikit-learn` site.\n",
    "\n",
    "One simple and commonly used method is ***k-fold* cross-validation**, which entails splitting up our dataset into *k* groups, holding out one group while training a model on the rest of the data, evaluating model performance on the held-out \"fold,\" and repeating this process *k* times (we'll get back to this in the text-analysis tutorial). Another method is **temporal validation**, which involves building a model using all the data up until a given point in time, and then testing the model on observations that happened after that point. Our problem of recidivism is a problem in time where we are trying to predcit an event in the future. Generally, if you use the future to predict the past there will be temporal effects that will help the accuracy of your predictions. We cannot use the future to predict the past in real life, so it is important to use `temporal validation` and create our training and test sets accordingly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our training set uses labels from 2005-2010. Starting at the very end of 2004 (Dec 31, 2004) we found all people admitted into prison that had been previously admitted into prison before 2005. This forms our recidivism label. The features are then developed using data from before the beginning of our label range (2005) from 1989-2005. *Note: it is important to segregate your data based on time when creating features. Otherwise there can be \"leakage,\" where you accidentally use information that you would not have known at the time.*  This happens often when calculating aggregation features; for instance, it is quite easy to calculate an average using values that go beyond our training set time-span and not realize it.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our testing set will use labels that fall between 2010-2015, and our features will be generated from 1989-2010. \n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that our testing set uses more data than our training set, because we have \"new\" data from 2005-2010. This emulates the way our models could be used in practice. Every five years we can run our model and make new predictions updating our dataset with the most recent five years of data. \n"
